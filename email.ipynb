    "1. internal methods\n",
    "2. external methods\n",

    "## Internal Methods:\n",
    "These methods are used my the object for the object to abstract some of the internally repeated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Above code, these are:\n",
    "* _POPULATE_CREDENTIALS\n",
    "    - this is used to check weather the email address and password has been provided by the user and if not </br> will check local environment variable for said information\n",
    "* _GET_DOT_ENV\n",
    "    - this is just a short script to handle the retrieval and conversion of data from the **.env** file (In this case, the email and passwords)\n",
    "* _CONNECT\n",
    "    - this is one of the hallmark functions. It's purpose is to connect and to a provided IMAP (Internet Messaging Access Protocol) services.\n",
    "    - These include but are not limited to:\n",
    "        + server interfacing\n",
    "        + server querying and searching\n",
    "        + indexing and data mapping\n",
    "    - In this instance we use it to form a connection object for retrieving emails from the server\n",
    "* _APPEND_DF\n",
    "    - this function replaces a deprecated functionality of pandas library where we can append data to the end of the DataFrame.\n",
    "    - it uses a non iterative or duplicating method, so its relatively fast to the deprecated version\n",
    "    - we use it here to manipulate and build on email Data Frames (Data Frames with email objects)\n",
    "* _LOGIN\n",
    "    - this is a function used to handle the security aspect of the login process. Due to time limitations,</br> the communication here is happening on a non secure and unencrypted connection\n",
    "    - is in some ways an extension of the _POPULATE_CREDENTIALS Function\n",
    "* _MAIL_INDEX\n",
    "    - this function is used to index the incoming emails and assign unique ID values to them while also fetching some pertinent information like the Email Subject and Byte ID values.\n",
    "    - This function is the primary interface between our connection and _CONNECT function to our Data structure and pandas Data Frame\n",
    "\n",
    "## External Methods:\n",
    "These are used to give functionality to the user associated with the object.\n",
    "These Functions are:\n",
    "* getEmailsFromLatest():\n",
    "    - This method access the interface connection and retrieves the last **N** Number of emails from the server\n",
    "    - in order to reduce run times, this is also when the contents of said emails is loaded into the local Data Frame **(obj.indexesDF)**.\n",
    "    - it returns an array object, with arrays of ID and value pairs: **[ID, EMAIL]**\n",
    "* getEmailRange():\n",
    "    - this Does a similar task as the above **getEmailsFromLatest()** function, but instead of retrieving the Last N emails, it retrieves the emails from a range **N** to **M**\n",
    "    - The output and functionality after retrieval remain the same\n",
    "* emailById():\n",
    "    - this is similar to the above two, but instead of retrieving a list of values, this only retrieves a single email. for this to work, the ID of said email will have to be determined before hand through one of the above two methods, or through searching the Data Frame Object. once the ID is known, Just insert it as a parameter, and run the function with a range of values to search fot the email.\n",
    "    - this function is so that in case we cant find said email via ID in the DataFrame, we retrieve and search a broader number of emails and localize a single email for processing\n",
    "    - the output, instead of being a list of lists, it is a single list with the ID and EMAIL: **[ID, EMAIL]**\n",
    "    **NOTE:** This method uses the **getEmailsFromLatest()** function to broaden and narrow the search\n",
    "* extractText():\n",
    "    - This function is used to extract Text from an email parameter, stripping away all the Header Information and all the other non essential parts for this project, like images HTML and other noise code.\n",
    "    - Returns sections of text in an array from the parts of the email that are text only\n",
    "* searchExtractText():\n",
    "    - This function works like the above, but takes in an email ID instead of an Email object. this allows for a combined functionality of searching, converting and extracting from email into a list of text sections\n",
    "* extractMultiText():\n",
    "    - this function is like the above two methods, but differs that it operates on multiple emails at once. extracting their text sections (parts) all at once and storing it into a new list of lists\n",
    "* mailSlice():\n",
    "    - this is the final step in converting emails into paragraph (sepprarator can be changed) units. it takes in a list of parts created from one of the first two methods above **(extractText() and searchExtractText())** and converts it into separate paragraphs\n",
    "* output():\n",
    "    - this is an added step to make output more user friendly by writing the output to a line separated text file.\n",
    "* end():\n",
    "    - this function is for closing the connection to the mail server completing the use of the object as well\n",
